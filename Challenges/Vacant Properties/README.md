## Data
For this challenge we were given two datasets: (1) a geocoded classification of North Side vacant properties from a [survey](https://gtechstrategies.org/resources/strengthening-northside-communities/) conducted by [GTECH Strategies](https://gtechstrategies.org/what-we-do/reclaim/) and (2) Allegheny County property assessment data for all North Side neighborhoods. Our first task was to merge these datasets so that we could compare the GTECH vacant property classification to information in the county property assessment database. We then split the combined dataset into subsets in order to investigate discrepancies between the GTECH survey and county data. 

The resulting datasets are as follows: 
* `vacancies_combined.csv` â€” The combined dataset including county assessment data for all North Side properties.
